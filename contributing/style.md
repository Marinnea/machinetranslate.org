# Style

Machine Translate was founded as an open guide for people who want to use machine translation in their work, products or services. They are diverse and busy, so the content should be high-level and understandable.

> **Less is more.**

## Default to Wikipedia style

Default to the Wikipedia's [Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style) with regard to:

* Content that's neutral, factual and evergreen
* Titles, capitalization, punctuation and formatting
* Linking to other articles with relative paths

Default to American English orthography and to International English vocabulary

## Minimal content

Unlike Wikipedia, the goal is to provide a helpful overview that is easy to read in full and easy to maintain.

Keep pages short, paragraphs short and sentences short and simple.

Avoid parentheses, except for defining common abbreviations.

## No marketing

Do not promote businesses and do not use clich√© or meaningless terms

* _language barriers_
* _multilingual audiences_

## Not too academic

Talk straight and make complex topics simple
