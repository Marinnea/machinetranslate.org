# Peter Toma
Peter Toma was a computer programmer who designed Systran, the oldest commercial machine translation program. 

He initially developed the program for the United States Air Force. 
It was intended to translate large-scale scientific documents from Russian into English during the Cold War. 

It was later acquired by the European Commission for English-to-French direction. 
The language pairs got expanded when the program was purchased and popularized by a French company.
