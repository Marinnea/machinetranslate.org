# Peter Toma
Peter Toma was a computer scientist and linguistics researcher. 

In 1956, Toma developed software for machine translation at the California Institute of Technology. 
The system translated Russian texts into English. Later, he worked at Georgetown University where the system 
Serna was developed for the same translation direction. 

In 1962, he founded a company which created the systems Autotran and Technotran. 
They were specialized in Russian-to-English translation in the fields of atomic energy and medicine.  

In the mid-1960s, with the support of the German Research Foundation Toma programmed the [Systran](/companies/systran.md) prototype. 

In 1968, he founded Latsec, which developed Systran for the United States Air Force.
It was intended to translate large-scale scientific documents from Russian into English during the Cold War.
